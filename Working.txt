Working 

CarA (leader) suddenly hard-brakes.

The emergency brake alert is encoded → transmitted → received by CarB.

CarB’s ADAS auto-brakes and also re-broadcasts the emergency alert.

CarC receives the alert from CarB and brakes automatically.

End result → a domino safety effect preventing rear-end collisions in the convoy
